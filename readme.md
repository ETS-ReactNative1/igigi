# Installation

Igigi was written with JavaScript on React Native, so it will theoretically run on any mobile device.

It has the standard React Native prerequisites; such as npm, expo, etc.

After cloning the repository, edit assets/igigi_sample.json to put your own data. Then, on the command prompt, go to your Igigi folder and type:

```
expo eject igigi
```

This will create two folderes: ios and android. Depending on the device you want to use, you can continue with XCode or Android Studio to install the app to your device.
